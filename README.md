write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This lesson will have me build a recipe website where I have an index page with links to different recipes.  This will demonstrate that I know how to create links to different pages on the web.  these pages will probably come from my own computer and other websites, so i will show absolute links and relative links.  I will only be using HTML code to build the site because I have not gotten to CSS yet. It will be a barebones site but will help me better understand how to link pages together and how to build a strong foundation for a site.
